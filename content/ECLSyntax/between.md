# BETWEEN

BETWEEN is an operator to check ranges of values. It is the same as <= and =>. It's the same as SQL BETWEEN operator.

## Syntax

```java
attr_name := seek_val BETWEEN low_val AND high_val;
attr_name := seek_val NOT BETWEEN low_val AND high_val;
```

| _Value_    | _Definition_                                         |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| attribName | The name by which the variable will be invoked.      |
| seek_val   | The value to be checked. Can be a dataset field too. |
| BETWEEN    | Required.                                            |
| NOT        | Optional, used for certain searches.                 |
| Low_val    | Low value in the range                               |
| AND        | Required                                             |
| high_val   | High value in the range                              |

#### Example

<pre id = 'BetweenExp_1'>

```java
/*
BETWEEN Example:
Examples using set of values.
*/

SomeInt  := 12;
SomeReal := 120.5;

CheckIntOne := SomeInt BETWEEN 10 AND 200;
CheckIntTwo := SomeInt NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 200;

OUTPUT(CheckIntOne, NAMED('CheckIntOne'));
OUTPUT(CheckIntTwo, NAMED('CheckIntTwo'));


CheckRealOne := SomeReal BETWEEN 50 AND 65;
CheckRealTwo := SomeReal NOT BETWEEN 150 AND 203.6;

OUTPUT(CheckRealOne, NAMED('CheckRealOne'));
OUTPUT(CheckRealTwo, NAMED('CheckRealTwo'));

```
